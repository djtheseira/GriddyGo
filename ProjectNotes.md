## Notes
##### Simple Compile/Run Instructions
Compile the file with go build in the folder directory
Run compiled file with ./[filename]

##### Go Notes
* To export a variable, the first letter must be capital. So for pi, use "math.Pi"

* Arrays are cool, but slicing is more popular.
  * When slicing, any changes impact the underlying array.

* Pointers: &, \*

##### Go?
* Golang is: 
  1. Compiled
  2. Concurrent
  3. Statically-typed
  4. Garbage-collected
  5. Efficient
  6. Scalable
  7. Readable
  8. Fast
  9. Open-source

* Built to run quickly with concurrency, doesn't run in threads. 

* The "main" package is how everything is the core of how everything is run.
